"""Speech to text: a recording becomes a transcript that the rest of the service treats like any document.

The recording goes to Groq's Whisper (the same key as the language model). What comes back is a list of timed
segments; this module turns them into readable text:

  - paragraphs, each starting with its time ("[12:30] ..."), so a summary or an answer can say when something
    was said and a person can find the place in the recording;
  - a page break every five minutes (retrieval.PAGE_BREAK), so chat citations point to a stretch of the
    recording ("page 3" is minutes 10 to 15) the way they point to a page of a PDF;
  - a first line that says what the text is ("Transcript of meeting.mp3 (length 34:12)"), so the language
    model knows it is reading speech with no speaker names and does not invent any.

Whisper is known to invent text over silence and noise ("Thanks for watching!"), so segments it itself rates as
probably not speech are dropped, and a segment repeated over and over is kept once.
