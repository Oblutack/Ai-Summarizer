"""Checks each sentence of a summary against the source text: which passages back it up, and how well.

This is deliberately plain text matching, not another model call. It is free, instant and gives the
same answer every time. What it measures is how much of a sentence's wording (and, separately, its
numbers) appears in a passage of the original. That catches the classic summarizer failures, such as
a figure that is not in the document, but it cannot judge meaning: a faithful paraphrase can score
as only partly found, and a sentence marked "not found" is a reason to look, not proof of an error.
