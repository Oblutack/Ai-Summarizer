"""Comparing two versions of a document: what changed, and does it matter.

Finding the changes is not left to the model. A program matches the two texts sentence by sentence, so every "before"
and "after" shown to a person is the exact text of one of the documents, and nothing a model might have imagined can
appear as a change. The model is asked only afterwards, about changes that are already certain: to say in a sentence
what each one means and how much it could matter. Its answer is read tolerantly and checked: a sentence that mentions
a number that is in neither version of the change is thrown away and replaced by a plain description.

The steps:
1. each text is cut into sentences (a bullet or a numbered item is one unit), remembering the page of each;
2. the two lists are matched (difflib) on a simplified form of each sentence, so capital letters, punctuation and
   spacing do not count as changes;
3. what differs becomes changes: added, removed, changed (with a word by word difference) or moved;
4. the numbers that disappeared and the numbers that appeared are listed for each change, by program;
5. the model explains the changes in batches and gives a short bottom line.
