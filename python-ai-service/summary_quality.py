"""Scores a summary against what the document is known to say.

The summary-quality check (evals/summary) summarizes documents whose facts are known and uses this module
to judge each result. Like attribution.py it is plain code, not another model: free, instant, and the same
answer every time, so a change to a prompt or a model can be measured and compared run to run.

What is measured, per summary:

  - facts       the things a good summary of this document must keep (a figure, a name, a deadline), given
                as patterns so that any reasonable wording is found. Reported as recall.
  - traps       mistakes this kind of document invites, given as patterns that must NOT appear: the wrong
                currency, a figure moved to the wrong month, "year on year" where the text says "on the
                previous quarter", a warranty exclusion turned into a coverage.
  - numbers     digits in the summary that appear nowhere in the document (attribution.py does the matching).
  - format      what the chosen style promises (bullets only, "Key Takeaways" and "Action Items", ...), and
                leaks such as "(about 70 words)", a "Here is your summary" preamble, or a "=====" underline.
  - language    that the summary is in the language that was asked for (English, Spanish, German, French).
  - length      words against the target. Reported on its own: models overshoot, and it is not an error.

A run is "clean" when it has no trap, no invented number, no format problem, the right language, and at least
`MIN_RECALL` of its facts. The share of clean runs is the headline number.
